Notes from the first segment of the course - Data Architecture Foundations

## What a Data Architect does

understand business needs
identify data assets
write a blueprint for a solution to meet business needs based on data available

## Characteristics of Data Architecture

- business needs first / customer centric
  - busines partnership, business goals, business process, constraints, industry specifics
- data integrity (accurate and consistent)
- data governance (ownership, security and access)
  - single source of truth
  - roles (who owns, who manages)
  - who can access data
- scalability and flexibility
    ability to handle greater load
    able to flex to meet different needs
- data retention (storing and archiving)
    backup, archive

## Data Governance

understanding roles over the data is important including

- data owners, have a good understand of meaning, data dictionaries, data quality etc, they are typically the business subject matter expert.
- data users, people who consume the data to carry out their role.
- data managers, typically ICT roles such as performance monitoring, user access, data security such as logging netowork penetration and security hardening

## Scalability

The ability to handle larger volumes of data and users. Some options are:

- replication (good for reading data, users can log onto seperate dbs to spread the load)
- sharding (good for writes, split the data into multiple dbs, can make reads complicated)

## Flexibility

The ability for the envrionment to handle a variety of use cases such as accountants vs data scientists. This can involve

- different architectures for different users, e.g. sandboxes for data scientists, relational dbs with applications on top for accountants.

## Business and Functional Requirements
