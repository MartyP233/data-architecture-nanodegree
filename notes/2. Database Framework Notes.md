# Data Framework Notes

## Data modelling

Models and schemas are different. A physical form of a model that can only be applied to one particular db technology e.g. mysql

Relational Modelling can be done at 3 levels

Conceptual - high level, entities and high level relationships only
Logical - entities with keys
Physical - entities, keys, other variables, data types

## Normalisation

Normalisation involves removing redundancy from data to improve data quality and improve write performance for systems using the data.

Mdelling to the 3rd normal form is common for OLTP systems. 1st and 2nd normal form can be useful data preparation steps on their own

- 1NF rules
  - Uses entities (tables)
  - Each cell in an attribute (column) has an atomic value (a single value)
  - No repeated groupings
  - No duplicate rows
- 2NF rules
  - Everything from 1NF
  - Ensure data integrity
  - All columns depend on the unique ID
- 3NF rules
  - Everything from 2NF
  - Remove transitive dependencies
